Reading List
======
Reading List is a webapp that allows users to search the Google Books index for books and add them to a personal reading list. 

How it works 
------
Simply input keywords into the search bar and press enter or click the search button.


To run Reading List on your local computer, download/clone the project to the appropriate directory. In your terminal, navigate to the root directory, and npm install.

At the command prompt cd frontend to get to the frontend folder and npm install once more. When your dependences have been installed, run npm start. If your browswer window doesn't automatically open to localhost:3000/, click the link to open a new window.
